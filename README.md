# Smart_Contracts
This repository includes a collection of basic smart contracts written as part of my learning experience.

The code included in this repository was written and tested on Remix IDE found here: https://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=null&version=soljson-v0.8.1+commit.df193b15.js

My guide to this repository is dApp University's Intro to Solidity found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipwxYa-F1uY

When testing the code, I used the JavaScript VM, a proxy Ethereum blockchain used for testing smart contracts.

In reality, the user would incure a gas fee to run each line of code on the Ethereum mainnet. We use the fake ETH accounts provided on the Remix IDE to pay the fake gas fees on the JavaScript VM.
